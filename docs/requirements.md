# Requirements Document

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the requirements for an agent-based trading pipeline platform that enables retail traders to create, configure, and deploy automated trading strategies through a visual interface. The platform uses AI agents orchestrated via CrewAI flows to analyze markets, generate signals, manage risk, and execute trades.

**Key Differentiators:**
- Visual pipeline builder similar to n8n for connecting AI agents
- Modular agent architecture with clean interfaces for extensibility
- Cost-efficient design with token tracking and hybrid LLM strategy
- Agent marketplace foundation for future monetization
- Multi-tenant architecture supporting concurrent pipeline executions

- **API Risk**: External API rate limits or outages
  - Mitigation: Caching, fallback providers, graceful degradation
  
- **Market Risk**: Users may lose money on trades
  - Mitigation: Clear disclaimers, risk management agent, demo mode
