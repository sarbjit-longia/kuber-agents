        This Disclaimer applies to the TradingPipeline platform, website, and services (collectively,
        the "Service") operated by <strong>Longia LLC</strong> ("Company", "we", "us", or "our").
        Please read this Disclaimer carefully before using the Service.
      </p>

      <h2>1. No Investment Advice</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>TradingPipeline does not provide investment advice, financial advice, trading advice,
        or any other form of professional advice.</strong> All content, AI-generated analysis, signals,
        strategies, and outputs provided through the Service are for informational and educational
        purposes only. Nothing on this platform should be construed as a recommendation to buy, sell,
        or hold any security, currency, or financial instrument.
      </p>

      <h2>2. Trading Risk</h2>
      <p>
        Trading stocks, options, forex, and other financial instruments involves substantial risk of loss
        and is not suitable for every investor. You should be aware that:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>You could lose some or all of your invested capital.</li>
        <li>Past performance is not indicative of future results.</li>
        <li>The value of investments can go down as well as up.</li>
        <li>Leverage and margin trading can amplify both gains and losses.</li>
        <li>Market conditions can change rapidly and without warning.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        You should not trade with money you cannot afford to lose. Before making any trading decisions,
        consider your financial situation, investment objectives, and risk tolerance. Consult with a
        qualified financial advisor if you are unsure.
      </p>

      <h2>3. AI Limitations</h2>
      <p>
        The AI agents within TradingPipeline use large language models (including OpenAI's GPT-4) and
        algorithmic analysis tools. You should understand that:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>AI models can and do produce incorrect, misleading, or inconsistent outputs.</li>
        <li>AI-generated strategies are not guaranteed to be profitable.</li>
        <li>AI models may "hallucinate" — generating plausible-sounding but factually incorrect analysis.</li>
        <li>The AI does not have real-time awareness of breaking news, regulatory changes, or other events that could impact markets.</li>
        <li>AI outputs should not be blindly followed. You are responsible for reviewing and validating all signals before they result in trades.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>4. Automated Trading Risks</h2>
      <p>
        Using automated trading pipelines carries additional risks beyond manual trading:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Technical failures:</strong> software bugs, server outages, network interruptions, or API failures may prevent orders from being placed, modified, or cancelled.</li>
        <li><strong>Execution risks:</strong> orders may be filled at prices different from expected due to slippage, market gaps, or low liquidity.</li>
        <li><strong>Configuration errors:</strong> incorrect pipeline settings, risk parameters, or ticker selections could lead to unintended trades.</li>
        <li><strong>Broker issues:</strong> third-party broker outages or API changes may affect trade execution.</li>
        <li><strong>Runaway trades:</strong> while risk controls (position limits, budget caps, bracket orders) are available, no risk management system is foolproof.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>5. Paper Trading vs. Live Trading</h2>
      <p>
        Paper trading results are simulated and may not reflect real trading conditions. Simulated
        results may differ materially from live results due to factors including slippage, partial fills,
        market impact, liquidity, and execution speed. A strategy that performs well in paper trading
        may perform differently with real capital.
      </p>

      <h2>6. Third-Party Services</h2>
      <p>
        TradingPipeline integrates with third-party services including brokerages (Tradier, Alpaca, OANDA)
        and AI providers (OpenAI). We are not responsible for the availability, accuracy, or performance
        of these third-party services. Your use of these services is subject to their respective terms
        and conditions.
      </p>

      <h2>7. No Guarantees</h2>
      <p>
        We make no guarantees regarding:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>The accuracy, completeness, or timeliness of any information provided by the Service.</li>
        <li>The profitability of any trading strategy, pipeline, or AI-generated signal.</li>
        <li>Uninterrupted or error-free operation of the Service.</li>
        <li>The suitability of the Service for your particular trading goals or risk tolerance.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>8. Regulatory Notice</h2>
