      <h2>5. AI Data Processing</h2>

        When AI agents in your pipeline execute, market data and your configured prompts are sent to
        OpenAI's API for analysis. This data may include ticker symbols, price data, technical indicator
        values, and your custom strategy instructions. We do not send your name, email, brokerage
        credentials, or other personally identifiable information to AI providers.
      </p>
      <p>
        Please refer to OpenAI's privacy policy and data usage policies for information on how they
        handle data received through their API.
      </p>

      <h2>6. Cookies</h2>
      <p>We use the following types of cookies:</p>

        <li><strong>Preference cookies:</strong> store your settings such as theme preferences.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        We do not use third-party advertising or tracking cookies. You can control cookies through
        your browser settings, but disabling essential cookies may prevent the Service from functioning.
      </p>

      <h2>7. Data Retention</h2>
