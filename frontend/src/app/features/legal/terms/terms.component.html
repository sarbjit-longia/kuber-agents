        Welcome to TradingPipeline. These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your access to and use of the
        TradingPipeline platform, website, and services (collectively, the "Service") operated by
        <strong>Longia LLC</strong> ("Company", "we", "us", or "our"). By accessing or using the Service,
        you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree, do not use the Service.
      </p>

      <h2>1. Eligibility</h2>
      <p>
        You must be at least 18 years old and capable of forming a binding contract to use the Service.
        By creating an account, you represent that you meet these requirements and that all information
        you provide is accurate and complete.
      </p>

      <h2>2. Account Registration</h2>
      <p>
        To access certain features, you must register for an account. You are responsible for maintaining
        the confidentiality of your login credentials and for all activity that occurs under your account.
        You agree to notify us immediately of any unauthorised use of your account.
      </p>

      <h2>3. Description of the Service</h2>
      <p>
        TradingPipeline is a software platform that allows users to design, configure, and run automated
        trading pipelines powered by artificial intelligence agents. The Service connects to third-party
        brokerage accounts to execute trades on your behalf based on pipeline configurations you create.
      </p>

      <h2>4. No Investment Advice</h2>
      <p>
        The Service is a technology tool only. <strong>Nothing provided by TradingPipeline — including
        AI-generated signals, strategies, analysis, or any other output — constitutes investment advice,
        financial advice, trading advice, or any other sort of advice.</strong> You are solely responsible
        for your own trading decisions and should consult with a qualified financial advisor before making
        any investment decisions.
      </p>

      <h2>5. AI and Automated Trading Disclaimers</h2>
      <p>
        The AI agents within the Service use large language models and algorithmic analysis to generate
        trading signals and strategies. You acknowledge and agree that:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>AI-generated outputs may be inaccurate, incomplete, or unsuitable for your situation.</li>
        <li>Past performance of any strategy or pipeline does not guarantee future results.</li>
        <li>Automated trading involves substantial risk of loss, including the potential loss of your entire investment.</li>
        <li>Technical failures, network outages, API errors, or broker issues may prevent trades from executing as expected.</li>
        <li>You are solely responsible for reviewing, approving, and monitoring all pipeline activity.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>6. Brokerage Connections</h2>
      <p>
        The Service integrates with third-party brokerages (e.g., Tradier, Alpaca, OANDA). We are not
        affiliated with, endorsed by, or responsible for these brokers. Your brokerage relationship is
        governed by your agreement with the respective broker. We are not responsible for the execution,
        settlement, or outcome of any trade placed through a connected broker.
      </p>

      <h2>7. Payment and Credits</h2>
      <p>
        Certain features of the Service require AI credits, which may be purchased or earned through
        promotions. Credits are non-refundable and non-transferable. We reserve the right to change
        pricing at any time with reasonable notice. Subscription fees, if applicable, are billed in
        advance on a recurring basis. You may cancel your subscription at any time, and cancellation
        will take effect at the end of the current billing period.
